What is Guanxi::Common?
=======================
Guanxi::Common is a support module for the other Guanxi components in the system. It's not
designed to be a standalone module. It just provides handy functionality that other modules
can use. You can even build it and use it outwith Guanxi.

How do I build it?
====================
Guanxi::Common uses a normal, easy-peasy Ant build file, build.xml. There's nothing to do apart
from typing:
ant
and watch it build.
When the build completes, you can find the jar file in:
[GUANXI::COMMON-HOME]/dist/jar
