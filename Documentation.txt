What is Guanxi::Common?
=======================
Guanxi::Common is a support module for the other Guanxi components in the 
system. It's not designed to be a standalone module. It just provides handy 
functionality that other modules can use. You can even build it and use 
it outwith Guanxi.

How do I build it?
====================
Before you can build Guanxi::Common you'll have to build SAMUEL first, 
then find the file build.properties in the root folder of the distribution 
and change the paths accordingly:

build.properties:
These won't need changed if you've downloaded Guanxi as a whole:
gx_lib.home=../../gx_lib
samuel.home=../../samuel

You'll have to tell the build where your servlet environment is:
servlet-api-jar=/usr/local/tomcat/common/lib/servlet-api.jar

Once you've modified build.properties, usually only to set the 
servlet-api path, you just type:
ant

and watch it build.
When the build completes, you can find the jar file in:
[GUANXI::COMMON-HOME]/dist/jar
